# Trigger Word Detection From Live Audio

# TO RUN THIS LIVE AUDIO DETECTION :-
1)RUN live_record.py 

2)RUN run.py IN A SEPERATE COMMAND WINDOW
||NOTE|| - BOTH .py FILES SHOULD RUN PARALLEL AT THE SAME TIME.

# OUTPUT:-
IT WILL OUTPUT A "CHARM WORD" IN THE TIME BETWEEN 1-3 SECONDS AFTER THE TRIGGER WORD "ACTIVATE" IS SAID.
NOTE, THAT THE TRIGGER WORD SHOULD BE PRONOUNCED CLEAR(CHECK "audios/activate.wav") IN OREDR TO GET RESULT

# MECHAMISM:-
THE FIRST FILE live_record.py RECORDS THE LIVE AUDIO FOR 2.5 SECONDS, THEN THE run.py MAKES PREDICTIONS BASED ON LIVE AUDIO

# CHANGING THE CHARM AUDIO:-
MAKE YOUR OWN CHARME AUDIO AND REPLACE IT WITH THE EXISTING ONE.
NOTE, THAT THE LENGTH OF THE CHARM AUDIO SHOULD BE IN 2 - 2.5 SECONDS 

# FURTHER ISSUES AND FEATURE REQUESTS
MAKE A ISSUE AT Issues SECTION BOTH FOR ISSUES AND FEATURE REQUESTS
NOTE, THAT IN ORDER TO GET A GOOD PREDICTION YOU HAVE TO TAKE PREDICTION TIME OF THE MODEL INTO AN ACCOUNT. IN MY CASE IT'S AVERAGE 0.89 SECOND IF IT'S MORE THAN 1 SECOND IN YOUR CASE THIS MAY BE A REASON WHY YOU ARE NOT GETTING THE RIGHT PREDICTION, IN THAT CASE OPEN AT Issue SECTION
